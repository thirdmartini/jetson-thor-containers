# jetson-thor-containers

This repository contains working containers of various tools built for the 
[Nvidia Jetson Thor](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-thor/). 

This is to simplify getting started with a new system, vs having to wrangle with the various 
versions and dependancies of pytorch and cuda packages.
